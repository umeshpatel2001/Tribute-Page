        <p id="tribute-info">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe WHO formally declared the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome
            coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak a pandemic on 11 March 2020 with the publication of public health
            guidelines to guide the pandemic response.1 Serious illness may need hospitalisation and ventilatory
            support.2 To reduce the risk of person-to-person viral transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Indian
            government introduced various measures including ‘lockdown’ on 23 March 2020 with ‘social distancing’ and
            ‘self-isolation’ strategies and recommended shielding of at-risk individuals.3 The lockdown measures reduced
            the movement of individuals and consequently has had a significant impact of daily life of Indian people
            with disruption of economic, social and access to healthcare facilities.4 5 This has made people fearful,
            anxious, and sometimes they have found it difficult to access emergency treatment.4 5 India has a
            combination of government and private healthcare facilities for providing medical care. Due to fear and to
            avoid the risk of spreading the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection, many hospitals have closed their
            doors to patients who have been trying to avail these facilities. This has led to restlessness, irritation
            and sometimes despair when trying to find medical help. As a consequence of this, people have shown their
            frustration by verbally abusing and threatening to physically assault doctors and other healthcare workers.

                    <h3>CURRENT SITUATION</h3>
                    <p>Doctors and healthcare workers who are responding to a global health crisis—trying to protect
                        individuals, families and communities in adverse situations with stretched resources, shortage
                        of
                        personal protective equipment (PPE) and other equipment’s—have found themselves as unexpected
                        targets in the fight against COVID-19.6 There have been several reported incidences of such
                        violence
                        against them during this pandemic time in India. Although the exact numbers of such cases cannot
                        be
                        determined, there are a few glaring examples: on 8 April 2020, two trainee doctors in New Delhi
                        were
                        allegedly assaulted by a neighbour who accused them of spreading the disease. On19 April 2020,
                        the
                        burial of a neurosurgeon who had died after contracting COVID-19 in Chennai was disrupted by a
                        mob
                        who attacked the undertakers. The citizens’ opposition was due to a misconception that the
                        contagion
                        may spread in the neighbourhood if the surgeon was buried there.7 A group of public health
                        workers
                        in Indore, a city in central India, who were trying to ‘contact-trace’ a person, were descended
                        upon
                        by a group of 100 people pelting stones and drove them away. Increasingly, reports pour in of
                        doctors being spat on, hurled abuses at and driven away.</p>

                    <h3>CHALLENGES FACED BY THE DOCTORS AND HEALTHCARE WORKERS</h3>
                    <p>The violence against doctors and other medical personnel has increased over the past few decades,
                        with up to 75% doctors facing this during their practice in India.8 Doctors attribute the surge
                        in
                        violence against healthcare workers to a mix of ignorance and fear, which is amplified by the
                        pandemic.9 The lockdown has exacerbated the problem, with patients unable to access healthcare
                        due
                        to transport suspension, fear of law enforcement and frustration following quarantine or
                        containment
                        zone restrictions. The types of attacks have ranged from verbal abuse, verbal threats or
                        aggressive
                        gestures in majority of cases.10 However, there have also been serious reports of manhandling,
                        abduction and murder.8</p>

                    <h3>STRATEGIES TO COMBAT VIOLENCE</h3>
                    <p>
                        A better and timely communication with the aggrieved patients and their family members is the
                        key to
                        avoid violence and untoward incidences.13 Due to shortage of time and to maintain social
                        distancing
                        norms, often the verbal and direct communication between doctors and patients is lacking during
                        this
                        pandemic. It leaves the patient and the family ‘in the dark’ and unsatisfied. The hospitals
                        should
                        designate some social workers and counsellors to coordinate with them on a regular basis to
                        allay
                        any fears.</p>

                    <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
                    <p>COVID-19 health crisis has exacerbated violence against doctors and healthcare workers. They have
                        become unforeseen targets in the fight against the current pandemic. For a sustainable
                        protection of
                        the healthcare workers, the current Ordinance needs to be further extended and incorporated into
                        existing laws in the form of a strict, permanent legislation that is strictly enforced. It would
                        improve the safety of the very individuals who carry out their duties fearlessly for the benefit
                        of
                        sick patients, either during a health crisis such as the current pandemic or during traditional
                        times.</p>
